In 2013 I was introduced ted by one of my colleagues. That time it seems boaring to me and I skipped. Time flies I saw people in my friendslist sharing ted talks to their feeds and that got my attention . I started listening few talks, I got amazed. Later if I face any issues with my life or If I need to know some solution from an expert I searched in ted videos, Most of the time I got very knowledgeable answers. So I though I should create a list which helps me to become the present me .
